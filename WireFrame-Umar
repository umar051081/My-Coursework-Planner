        <h1> Purpose of Wireframe </h1>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic, skeletal representation of a website or app's layout and structure, <br>focusing on the arrangement of content and features without detailed design elements like colors or images. It's a blueprint for how a product will look and function, helping designers, developers, and 
          stakeholders understand the user interface before diving into visual design.  </p>

        <h1> Purpose of ReadMe File </h1>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of a README.md file is to serve as a user guide and introduction to a project,<br> especially in software development and GitHub repositories. It provides essential information about the project, including its purpose, usage instructions, and how to contribute. 
          Essentially, it's the first document a user should consult when encountering a new project or codebase.

        <h1> What is branch in Git? </h1>
        <p>
          A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. <br>
          You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history.
